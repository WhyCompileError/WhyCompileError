## WhyCompileError

*"me write code. code no work. why compile error?"*


## About Me
Hi! I am Emily the one who is behind WhyCompileError. I learn to write code, cry a little bit, and document so future me can look back and learn... or maybe laugh.

## 🌱Skill Tree Unlocks

**✅Unlocked:**
- **HTML** - Structured pages, woot woot.
- **CSS** - Everything was centered... eventually.

**🔄In Progress:**
- **C** - memory leak? compiler yells? ask why compile errors.

**🔒Future Unlocks:**
- **JavaScript** - the final  piece of the front-end ritual.

<br>

## The Strategy:
1.  Write code.
2.  Hope the compiler doesn't yell at me.
3.  Wonder why compiler error. Cry.
4.  Fix it (hopefully).
5.  Document it so future me suffers less.
